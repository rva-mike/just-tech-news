# # just-tech-news

## Description

This project is a continuation to a back-end to create a full-stack application. The idea of this app 'Just Tech News', is a tech news website where users can post, upvote, and comment on links to news articles.The front end uses Handlebars.js, a popular templating engine. The application’s codebase will also be structured to follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm, to ensure a separation of concerns. Finally, to provide authentication, I built on the password hashing from the application’s back end so that logged-in users can update and delete their posts through a special dashboard interface.


### This project involved learning and implementing: 

   - Writing middleware functions for Express.js.

   - Using middleware to restrict access to certain routes.

   - Organize a codebase following the MVC paradigm.

   - Creating templates with Handlebars.js to reduce the amount of front-end JavaScript needed.

   - Implement built-in and custom helpers in Handlebars.js to help with formatting.

   - Store and use data saved on a back-end session.

### The following tools were used in this application:

 Handlebars.js / https://handlebarsjs.com/

Handlebars is a logicless templating language that keeps the View and the code separate and compiles templates into JavaScript functions. It’s an extension to the Mustache templating language. Although there is a standard Handlebars npm package, we used the Express Handlebars package as the View engine for your Express.js applications.

The express-session package / https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session

The express-session package is an Express.js middleware that uses sessions, a mechanism that helps applications to determine whether multiple requests came from the same client. Developers may assign every user a unique session so that their application can store the user state, and thus authenticate users.

The connect-session-sequelize package / https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-session-sequelize

The connect-session-sequelize package provides applications with a scalable store for sessions. The express-session package’s default server-side session storage, MemoryStore, is purposely not designed for a production environment, will leak memory under most conditions, doesn’t scale past a single process, and is only meant for debugging and developing. The connect-session-sequelize package resolves these issues and is compatible with the Sequelize ORM.
